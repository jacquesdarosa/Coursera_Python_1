x = 5
print('hello')

def print_lyrics():
    print("I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.")
    print("I sleep all night and I work all day")

print("Yo")
print_lyrics()
x = x +2
print(x)

# 1 step: I will print now then the print statements, but those under the def print_lyrics will NOT BE PRINTED as I'm not calling the function()

## 2nd step I wil call the function print_lyrics() and the statements under this function will be printed out,
# in the order I gave the function to be called:
# hello; Yo; I'n a lumberjack.... ; I sleep all night....; 7
