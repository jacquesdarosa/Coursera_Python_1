#  A function is like a variable except that it holds code

def thing():
    print("Hello")
    print("Fun")
# if I run this function nothing will happen(it won't print) since I did not call it using the name of the function thing()

thing()
# now that I called the function thing(), it will print first I only printed the Hello and Fun  to test it, 
# then I wrote other print statements here below:

print('Zip')
thing()
print('Wicked!')
thing()

# finally it printed out everything single print statement

# there are also built-in function like int(), float(), max(), min(), type(), input() .... and others
